#dwm

Since I used a heavily patched version of dwm in the presentation, I figured it
needs its own git repository. 

It can be found at
<https://github.com/Jereviendrai/dwm_patches/tree/mydwm>

Note that all the relevant changes are on branch __mydwm__, NOT on master. 

The above git repository is a clone of the official dwm git repository and hence contains
all the dwm source code. You can use my repository to build dwm on your system, if you so
choose, or you can use the [official repository](http://git.suckless.org/dwm) and apply patches
yourself.

For documentation on dwm, see <http://dwm.suckless.org/>
